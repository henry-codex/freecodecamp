		<header>HTML and CSS</header>      
    
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML is a markup language that consists of a set of tags, each of which denotes a different element in the document. These elements can include headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.</p>
    <p>HTML is a relatively simple language to learn and is an essential part of web development. It provides the foundation for web pages, allowing them to be structured and styled with CSS.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="SQL_and_NoSQL">
			<header>SQL and NoSQL</header>
  <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to store and retrieve data from databases, as well as to perform various operations such as creating tables, modifying data, and querying data. SQL is a standardized language used by most relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
  <p>Some of the key concepts in SQL include tables, columns, rows, and queries. SQL allows developers to define relationships between tables, enforce data integrity, and optimize performance.</p>
  <p>Some popular SQL frameworks and libraries include Hibernate, JPA, and Spring Data.</p>
  <h2>Why Learn SQL?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL is used in many industries and applications, from finance to healthcare to e-commerce.</li>
    <li>SQL is a standardized language used by most relational database management systems.</li>
    <li>SQL allows developers to store and retrieve data efficiently, and perform various operations on the data.</li>
    <li>SQL provides a structured approach to managing data, which helps ensure data integrity and consistency.</li>
    <li>SQL is a valuable skill for developers, data analysts, and data scientists.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>SQL vs. NoSQL</h2>
  <p>SQL and NoSQL are both used to manage data, but they differ in their approach to data storage and retrieval. Some of the key differences between them are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL is based on a relational model, while NoSQL is based on a non-relational or distributed model.</li>
    <li>SQL is suitable for structured data, while NoSQL is suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.</li>
    <li>SQL provides strong consistency, while NoSQL provides weaker consistency.</li>
    <li>SQL is better suited for complex queries and joins, while NoSQL is better suited for high-volume data processing and distributed data.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

    <header>NoSQL</header>
    <p>NoSQL stands for "not only SQL" and refers to a class of database management systems that don't rely on traditional relational database structures. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data models, such as document-based, key-value, graph, and column-family. NoSQL databases are often used for applications that require high scalability and availability, such as web applications and big data processing.</p>
    <p>Some of the popular NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Redis. Each of these databases has its own strengths and weaknesses and is better suited for specific use cases.</p>
    <h2>Why Use NoSQL?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data.</li>
      <li>NoSQL databases can handle unstructured and semi-structured data more efficiently than traditional SQL databases.</li>
      <li>NoSQL databases are often used for real-time applications and big data processing.</li>
      <li>NoSQL databases are flexible and can adapt to changing data models and requirements.</li>
      <li>NoSQL databases can provide better performance and availability compared to traditional SQL databases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>NoSQL vs. SQL</h2>
    <p>NoSQL and SQL databases have different data models and structures, which makes them better suited for different use cases. Some of the key differences between NoSQL and SQL databases are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require high scalability and availability.</li>
      <li>SQL databases are better suited for applications that require complex querying and data integrity.</li>
      <li>NoSQL databases are often used for unstructured and semi-structured data, while SQL databases are better suited for structured data.</li>
      <li>NoSQL databases provide better performance and availability compared to traditional SQL databases.</li>
      <li>SQL databases have a more mature and established ecosystem, with a larger community and better tooling support.</li>

<section class="main-section" id="Version_Control_with_Git">
			<header>Version Control with Git</header>
  <p>Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used in software development to manage source code. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel.</p>
  <p>Git allows developers to track changes to their code over time, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of their code. Git uses a decentralized model, which means that each developer has their own copy of the repository and can make changes independently. These changes can be merged together to create a final version of the code.</p>
  <p>Some of the key features of Git include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Version control: Git allows developers to track changes to their code over time, making it easy to revert to previous versions or identify when a particular change was made.</li>
    <li>Branching and merging: Git allows developers to create different branches of their code to work on different features or fixes. These branches can be merged together when the changes are complete.</li>
    <li>Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, without conflicts or overwriting each other's changes.</li>
    <li>Code review: Git allows developers to review each other's changes and provide feedback before they are merged into the main codebase.</li>
    <li>Integration: Git can be integrated with many other tools and services, such as continuous integration and deployment pipelines, issue tracking systems, and code editors.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Why Use Git?</h2>
  <p>Using a version control system like Git offers many benefits for software development, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Version history: Git allows developers to easily see changes to their code over time and revert to previous versions if necessary.</li>
    <li>Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, without conflicts or overwriting each other's changes.</li>
    <li>Code review: Git allows developers to review each other's changes and provide feedback before they are merged into the main codebase.</li>
    <li>Branching and merging: Git allows developers to create different branches of their code to work on different features or fixes. These branches can be merged together when the changes are complete.</li>
    <li>Backup and recovery: Git provides a backup of the codebase, which can be used to recover the code in case of hardware failure or other disasters.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Git vs. Other Version Control Systems</h2>
  <p>Git is not the only version control system available. Some of the other popular systems include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Subversion (SVN): a centralized version control system that has been widely used in the past, but is now less popular than Git.</li>
    <li>Mercurial: a distributed version control system that is similar to Git in many ways, but has a smaller user base.</li>
    <li>Perforce: a commercial version control system that is popular in enterprise environments.</li>
  </ul>
